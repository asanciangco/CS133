1. Install

To compile the program, use
./make

This will generate two files in './bin' directory, which are:
./bin/dwt2d	- 2D DWT transformation
./bin/dwt3d - 3D DWT transformation

2. Run

2.1 2D DWT

The program takes input from a regular monocolor BMP file. There are few such files available under './data/*.bmp'.
To run the 2D DWT, first specify the input filename, then choose the level of transformation. The level is optional, and will be selected as one if left blank.

For example, the following command transforms image 'head.bmp' with three levels:
# ./bin/dwt2d ./data/head.bmp 3

The output of the program will be a BMP image named 'dwt_out.bmp'.

2.2 3D DWT

The program takes input from a binary file, in which the image is stored in the column-first format. There are few such files available under './data/*.dat'.
To run the 3D DWT, first specify the input filename, then choose the level of transformation. The level is optional, and will be selected as one if left blank.

For example, the following command transforms image '3d192f.dat' with three levels:
# ./bin/dwt3d ./data/3d192f 3
